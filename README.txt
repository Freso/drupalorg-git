The set of scripts is designed to import the Drupal.org CVS repositories in git.



Notes:
Currently, the patch cvs2svn-2.3.0.patch must be applied to
cvs_revision_manager.py in your cvs2svn_lib directory. You may need to run
"find / -name cvs_revision_manager.py" to find this file if you installed it
using your distro's package manager.
